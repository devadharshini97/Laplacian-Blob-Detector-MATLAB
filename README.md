# Laplacian-Blob-Detector-MATLAB
Implemented a Laplacian Blob Detector using a LoG filter in scale space. Performed non-max suppression and displayed the resulting circles at their characteristic scales. I tried this Blob detector in both Python and MATLAB. In this repository, the MATLAB code with the results are placed and the laplacian of Gaussian is used. For the python code, refer Laplacian-Blob-Detector repository where difference of gaussian is used.

Note: This project is implemented based on the harris corner detector algorithm. The harris detector file attached in this repository is only for reference; it is not used inside the main function.
