# Laplacian-Blob-Detector-MATLAB
Implemented a Laplacian Blob Detector using a LoG filter in scale space. Performed non-max suppression and displayed the resulting circles at their characteristic scales. I tried this Blob detector in both Python and MATLAB. In this repository, the Python code with the results are placed and the difference of Gaussian is used. For the MATLAB code, refer Laplacian-Blob-Detector-Matlab repository.

Note: The convolution and the DFT functions from the previous repository (convolution_and_dft repository) is used in this project.
